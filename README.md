# Word_Guess_Game
A hangman-style game that runs in the browser, using HTML, CSS, and Javascript

-------------------------

This project is part of the front-end curriculum for the University of Washington Part-time Coding Bootcamp, presented by Trilogy Education. It served as a light introduction to Javascript conditional scripting with dynamic writing to the DOM.

The minimal objectives of this assignment were to create a hang-man style word guessing game, 
* Set a hidden puzzle answer from an array of possible choices, 
* Accept a user input from a keyboard action, 
* Determine correct and incorrect guesses, 
* Update DOM display of incorrect guesses and puzzle progress, as well as a win or lose alert.

CHALLENGES:

As a learning challenge, this project helped me understand and practice a number of Javascript skills:
* Holding many of the game parameters and functionality within an object
* Functional programming for various elements of preparing and manipulating variable and game conditions
*
